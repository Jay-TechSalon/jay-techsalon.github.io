          Recent Work: Interaction Design - GFGF App
        </h1>
        <p class="post-copy">
          Creating an interactive app with presentational software allows a designer the ability to represent a working design concept. Many pieces of software allow this to happen, I have used everything from After Effects, Pop, Proto.io, and Keynote.

              <h2>Sketching out Ideas</h2>
              <p>
                Growing up in the analog age, where art always referred to the physical, I gravitate to sketching. Adobe Ideas takes me further then pen and paper.

              <p>
               This is the front screen for the app Guilty for Gluten Free. This app was designed from the ground up, all graphics, logos, and photography I created.

          <p>This is a small video with voice over, showcasing the app in action. Proto.io allows you to save the presentation to the phone and the interactions work as if the app had be actually coded. This video clip was an addition to the presentation produced to show my process in the apps creation.</p>

              <h2>Tools Make it Possible</h2>
              <p>
                Before coding, one can try out the many different possibilities that an app can have built into it, testing the usability. Here are some good ones.

              <h2>Proto.io Layout Features</h2>
              <p>
                Proto.io was realitively easy to learn, but like most software you must learn the quirks. Most everything I wanted to try was built in, some was not.
