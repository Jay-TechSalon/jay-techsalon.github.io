  In this sprint we set out to create a MEAN (Mongo DB, Express, Angular, Node) app with a backend JavaScript team. This app teaches concepts of a binary tree structure with a demo, an interactive component built with the JavaScript D3 library.

  Jumping in Ember I decided to create a project with a 4-5 hour range. Basic idea came from the setInterval expression, a timer function built in to Ember. That sparked an idea to make a basic "take a break" timer that would last for 3 minutes.

.ex-large {
  font-size: 5rem;
  color: $third_color;
  &:hover {
    color: $fourth_color;
    transition: all .30s ease;
  }
}

In this sprint we set out to create the UX &amp; UI for an Angular app with a backend JavaScript team. This app utilizes D3 library.<br>

First look at Ember, MVP was to create a simple break app for myself in 4-5 hours, which was accomplished. Now time to take a break.<br>

Working with the file API and finding something a bit different in its use case, using the CSS3 background-clip selector. One day MVP.<br>
