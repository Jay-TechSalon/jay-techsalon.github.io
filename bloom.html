          Recent Work: Bloom UI Pattern Library
        </h1>
        <p>
          This project consisted of four Front-End UX Web Developers and was conducted in a four day sprint. Besides writing a lot of code, I utilized my visual design skills and created the design aesthetic for the prject.
        </p>
        <p>UI patterns help developers set up a strategy for consistency right from the start. This library was designed thinking of the end user. In this case it was for any developers that want to test out their ideas but do not wish to write any CSS. Grab the code and try it out today.</p>

              <p>
                With Node.js feeding content to the page using routes we wanted to create a certain look to the overall site. This was one of the earlier sketches I did for the front page.

              <h2>Basic Fonts and Logo</h2>
              <p>
                Our team decided to make this UI pattern library look good on the outside as much as we did on the inside. I took charge of the creation of the look of the logo and fonts.

              <h2>Our Node.js Tree</h2>
              <p>
                Using Express right from the start gave us a great foundation for our app. From here we created many views and utilizing Sass we created a well structured styling schema.

            Structure and App Development in Node JS

          <p>
            Above you can see the folder structure on the Node application for Bloom. This structure was deliberately setup and this helped keep the project flowing. With a team of four and a tight deadline, this structure allowed us to all work on specific components or views without overlap, aka "merge conflicts".</p>
