          Recent Work: 4 Day Sprint - Angular App
        </h1>
        <p class="post-copy">
          On this project the team consisted of three JavaScript students and two UX students. Taking a position of team UX lead, my partner Mimi and I, supported the team with the creation of assests and all the views in the Angular App. We worked hand in hand in the MEAN App environment getting to know our way around, which consisted of a Mongo Database, Express build, Angular framework, and a Node server.

          <p>We started off in one direction and our JavaScript team's teacher ended up changing up our MVP on day two. Luckily we, the UX team, had all ready mocked up a few different wireframes and could utilize existing modular layouts. That being said, we did scrap a lot of work. Losing wireframes, user flows, and the code for the users page of the site. This was a great learning process atleast for the UX team.</p>
